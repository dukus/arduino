This very basic example of the Tap library uses:

* 1x Push Button
* 1x 10k&#8486; resistor
* 1x Arduino Uno
* 1x Small Breadboard

I've included the [Fritzing Sketch](https://github.com/d2kagw/arduino-tap-library/raw/master/example/sketch.fz), but the schematic is real simple:
![see, really simple](https://github.com/d2kagw/arduino-tap-library/raw/master/example/fritzing.png)

Simply run the [example.pde](https://github.com/d2kagw/arduino-tap-library/raw/master/example/example.pde) file on your Arduino.

When you press the button, you should only see it print `Down` once in your Serial Monitor per-press.

Easy peasy.
